    "### Classic NN Structure\n",
    "- Here we have a simple feed forward neural network that\n",
    "- It has a single hidden fully connected layer\n",

    "![neural net](http://white.stanford.edu/teach/images/5/57/Feedforward.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Convolution?\n",
    "- Convolution is a mathematical term, defined as applying a function repeatedly across the output of another function. \n",
    "    - In this context it means to apply a 'filter' over an image at all possible offsets. \n",

    "- Convolution kernels take the place of the fully connected nodes in the first few layers\n",
    "- CNN's are exelent texture classifiers\n",
    "- To shrink the amount of variables weight sharing is used\n",
    "    - This basicaly means the same kernel is used across the entire input image space\n",
    "    - Because of this CNN's are naturally translation invariant\n",
    "- The \"nodes\" change slightly in this structure\n",
    "    - Think of each pixel of the input image ( and the outputs of the convolution layers) as a node\n",
    "    - Think of each convolution kernel as a node\n",
    "        - Its not fully connected, only takes input from its window size\n",
    "    - Is applied multiple times across the entire output of the previous layer\n",
    "    - Each convolution layer will have multiple kernels that it trains\n",
    "- Subsampling is applied in CNN's\n",
    "    - normaly used just to shrink the problem space\n",
